# APCS-thesis-template

This is our Overleaf thesis template for our university program APCS.

We are:
* Lê Phạm Ngọc Yến:

Our thesis topic: INTEGRATING NÔM LANGUAGE MODEL INTO NÔM OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION.

Both of us promise (to ourselves lol) that if our final score for our thesis exceed a threshold then we will make this template public.

This template does not contain everything that I use in my thesis as I only add more when we need it.
However, in this README, I will try my best explain thing that I find useful during the writing process.
Hopefully, you will find this template somewhat suitable to your need because I spent more than a day to gather everything :>
