Our thesis topic: INTEGRATING NÔM LANGUAGE MODEL INTO NÔM OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION. (2021)

Both of us promise (to ourselves lol) that if our final score for our thesis exceed a threshold then we will make this template public.

This template does not contain everything that I use in my thesis as I only add more when we need it. <br>
However, in this README, I will try my best explain thing that I find useful during the writing process. <br>
Hopefully, you will find this template somewhat suitable to your need because I spent more than a day to gather everything :>

You will only need to download ``APCS-thesis-template.zip`` and ``thesis-cd-cover.drawio``. ``APCS-thesis-template.pdf`` is only a preview for you to know how the template will render.

SOME INSTRUCTIONS:

* ``preliminaries`` folder is where I store front matter .tex file like **thesis proposal**, **acknowledgement**, etc.
* ``cover-templates`` folder is where I store cover templates like **main cover**, **title page**, etc. <br>
  However, I also put ``comments-of-thesis-advisor.tex`` and ``comments-of-thesis-reviewer.tex`` in there because I we only need theses 2 files after thesis defense. But you can to move them to ``preliminaries`` folder if you want, just remember to change these 2 code lines:

  ``\input{cover-templates/comments-of-thesis-advisor}`` <br>
  ``\input{cover-templates/comments-of-thesis-reviewer}``

* ``configurations.tex`` is the file that I put most of my packages and commands. I separate the package and the command according to (self-defined) categories.

SOME USEFUL TIPS:
